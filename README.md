I had diffuculty getting my rows to change different colors and separating them on the html. I went to a tutoring session and unfortunely the time went by faster than I liked it to and I just barely got into the javascript part of the session. we went over a few topics in the tutor session and I gound it very helpful and made me feel more confident about my coding skills.
